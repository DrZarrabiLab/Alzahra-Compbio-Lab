# Welcome to the Computational Biology Lab at Alzahra University!

Explore the forefront of computational biology with our dedicated team, led by Dr. Mahboobeh Zarrabi, as we delve into the intricate realms of biological systems. Our primary focus lies in groundbreaking research on cancer and antibiotic resistance, employing advanced computational methods.
# Research Focus:
Our lab is committed to developing realistic models of cancer and antibiotic resistance phenomena through the application of Machine Learning, Molecular Dynamics, and Computational Fluid Dynamics methods. We investigate various aspects, including:

* Modeling realistic membranes of cancer cells
* Modeling realistic bacterial membranes in planktonic and biofilm states
* Mechanobiology of bacterial biofilm
* Drug delivery simulations with a primary focus on intranasal peptide delivery
* Identification of potential drug targets
* Prediction of antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of peptide-based therapeutics
* Prediction of protein druggability

We are committed to advancing the field of computational biology and collaborating with other researchers to develop new approaches and tools for studying biological systems. Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions or collaboration opportunities!
# Tools and Libraries
* **PyBiofilm:** A machine learning-based approach for predicting the antibiofilm properties of peptide-based therapeutics.
* **hiABF:** A machine learning-based approach for predicting high activity of peptides against bacteria in the biofilm state.
* **PepINDD:** A machine learning-based simulation approach for predicting dosage deposition in upper respirartory system.
* **CancerDyna:** Library of realistic cancer cell membranes assembled and equilibrated by Molecular dynamics.
* **BiofilmDyna:** This library contains bacterial membrane models for both planktonic and biofilm states, considering the age of the biofilm to determine its composition based on laboratory results. Plankt, BF1, BF2, and BF6 refer to the planktonic state, 24-hour, 48-hour, and 6-day biofilm, respectively.
* **PeptiPy:** Virtual screening of peptide-based therapeutics.
