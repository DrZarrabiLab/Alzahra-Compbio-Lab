# Alzahra-CompBio_Lab
Welcome to the Computational Biology Lab at Alzahra University! Our lab, led by Dr. Mahboobeh Zarrabi, is focused on using computational methods to study biological systems, with a particular emphasis on cancer and antibiotic resistance research.

Our lab aims to develop realistic models of cancer and antibiotic resistance phenomena using Machine Learning, Molecular Dynamics, and Computational Fluid Dynamics methods. We use computational methods to investigate various aspects of cancer and antibiotic resistance, including:

* Modelling realistic membranes of cancer cells
* Modelling realistic bacterial membranes in planktonic and biofilm states
* Modelling of the mechanobiology of bacterial biofilm
* Identifying potential drug targets
* Predicting antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of peptide-based therapeutics
* Predicting protein druggability

We are committed to advancing the field of computational biology and collaborating with other researchers to develop new approaches and tools for studying biological systems. Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions or collaboration opportunities!
# Tools and Libraries
* **PyBiofilm**: a machine learning-based approach for predicting the antibiofilm properties of peptide-based therapeutics.
* **hiABF**: a machine learning-based approach for predicting high activity of peptides against bacteria in the biofilm state.
* **CancerDyna**:Library of realistic cancer cell membranes assembled and equilibrated by Molecular dynamics
* **BiofilmDyna**: This library contains bacterial membrane models for both planktonic and biofilm states, taking into account the age of the biofilm to determine its composition based on laboratory results. Plankt, BF1, BF2, and BF6 refer to the planktonic state, 24-hour, 48-hour, and 6-day biofilm, respectively.
* **PeptiPy**: Virtual screening of peptide-based therapeutics
* **ProtiPharm**: A machne learning-based approach for predicting protein druggability
* **BiofilmMech**: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Approach for Predicting and Modeling the Mechanical Behavior of Bacterial Biofilm.
